Super Simple API Server
=======================

This is a very, very basic example of an API server. There is only one 
endpoint, that is the root level (http://localhost:8000/).

So this code doesn't really do much but it demonstrates how to reference 
multiple js files in your project. I.e., server.js references controller.js 
which references service.js.
